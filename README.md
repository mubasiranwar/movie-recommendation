## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv movie-env
source movie-env/bin/activate  # Windows: movie-env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash

```

### 4️⃣ Launch Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 5️⃣ Start Exploring! 
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to start getting movie recommendations! 🎉

## 🧠 How It Works

### Recommendation Algorithm:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Movie metadata is cleaned and processed into feature vectors
2. **Feature Engineering**: Text data (genres, cast, overview) converted using TF-IDF vectorization
3. **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity calculated between all movie pairs
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Top-N most similar movies retrieved for user selection
5. **Interactive Display**: Results presented through intuitive Streamlit interface

### Core Implementation:
```python
# Similarity calculation workflow
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Transform movie features into vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
feature_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(movie_features)

# Calculate similarity scores
similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(feature_matrix)
```

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy on Render:
1. **Fork/Upload** your repository to GitHub
2. **Connect** GitHub repo to Render dashboard
3. **Configure Build**:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0`
4. **Deploy** and receive your live application URL! 🚀



### Environment Configuration:
The `setup.sh` script handles Streamlit configuration for cloud deployment:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/
echo "[server]\nheadless = true\nport = $PORT\nenableCORS = false\n" > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
```
