- 🖥️ Simple web interface using **Streamlit** / **Flask** (depending on your implementation).
- 📂 Handles thousands of movies efficiently.
- ☁️ Deployable on **Render** for public access.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Scikit-learn** for similarity computations
- **Pickle** for storing pre-computed models
- **Streamlit / Flask** for the front-end
- **Render** for deployment
